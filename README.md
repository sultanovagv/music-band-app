# Problem description
Every night the below bands play. Also, Jay Aly’ who plays a five-stringed guitar, with string-size .5 mm,
made by Screen22 is eager to join any band that would allow her since her previous band was dissolved.
More bands will join soon.

Bands can have any number of members as long as there are not more than one of each instrument
present. Every day each band loses a random member, if there are any. Bandless musicians try joining
a random band.
Task Description
Write a console application, which provides the following menu options in its first version.
1. List - List all bands by name with their members and the properties of their instruments.
2. Play one night - Execute logic for each band to lose a random member and musicians without a
   band to try joining a random band. Print all changes to the console. For example ”Musician Mr
   One left Adrenal’Ex. Musician A Gaze Inks left I’d Seen. Musician Jay Aly’ joined I’d Seen.”
3. Exit - Exit the program
   Write a short design document describing the most important aspects of the design. Use the Java programming language to implement the application. Object-oriented design as well as high quality code
   are key factors. Using relevant coding conventions will give you additional points.
   If some part of the exercise is unclear, do not worry. Decide what would be a logical or fun thing
   to do, and explain in the design document why this choice was made. Do not put your name into
   any files or paths. When done, deliver the whole package as a zip-file via email and ensure it contains
   everything needed to create the running program to verify it.
